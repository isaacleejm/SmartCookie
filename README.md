SmartCookie is a Fortune Cookie studying software, which allows users to input their study material into SmartCookie for an AI to read and analyse their study material, then based on their provided study material, the AI will generate daily fortunes, advice, tips, motivational quotes, and fun predictions to enlighten the user’s study journey.
